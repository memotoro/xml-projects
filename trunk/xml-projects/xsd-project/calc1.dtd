<!-- This is a simple format for excoding arithmetic 
     expressions on integers. The operations in question
     are +, -, and *. The output is always an integer. 
     
     This DTD was written by Bijan Parsia in 2010 and is put into
     the public domain. 
     
     This is also used in the SAXCalc assignment. -->
     
<!-- Notice the level of commenting! -->

<!-- I used parameter entities in order to simplify
     the DTD, as well as making it both more readable
     and more modular. If I want to add a decimal type
     or an additional operation (such as division), I 
     need only touch this declaration. -->

<!-- This is my intended root element. -->
<!ELEMENT expression %expr;>

<!-- plus and times are n-ary, where n is greater
     than 2. Note that it's very important that the 
     repetition operator is *inside* the parenthesis! (Why?)-->

<!-- Ints are empty elements. I use an attribute
     for the value. There's no special reason
     for this other than I can put an *inadequeate*
     type constraint on it. It's not even shorter, viz.:
        <int>576</int>
        <int value="572"/>-->
