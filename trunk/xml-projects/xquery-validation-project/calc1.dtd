<!-- plus and times are n-ary, where n is greater or equal to

<!-- Ints are empty elements. I use an attribute
     for the value. There's no special reason
     for this other than I can put an *inadequate*
     type constraint on it. It's not even shorter, viz.:
        <int>576</int>
        <int value="572"/>-->
